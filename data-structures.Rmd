```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Episode data types 

* Download and read file in

```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv", destfile = "data/gapminder_data.csv")
```

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")
```

## We can also read in file from web

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv")

```

* What do we have, we can run the `str()` function on any R object: 

```{r}
str(gapminder) #str stands for structure 
```

* We can get it to open up in a tab in RStudio a couple of ways: 

```{r eval=FALSE}

View(gapminder) #to look at it in a tab 

```

## Data types 

R has a few data types it is good be aware of: 

```{r}
typeof(gapminder$year)
typeof(gapminder$lifeExp)
typeof(3.14)
typeof(TRUE)  # logical 
typeof(1L) # The L suffix forces the number to be an integer, since by default R uses float numbers
typeof('bannana')
class(gapminder)
typeof(gapminder$continent)
typeof(gapminder$country) #character

```

* No matter how complicated our analyses become, all data in R is interpreted as one of these basic data types. 
* This strictness has some really important consequences.

```{r}
typeof(gapminder$year)
```

## Vectors 

* Let's step back and talk a bit about vectors. 
* Dataframes are a collection of vectors 
* Vectors can only be of one type. 
* When we create vectors this has important consequences - R will coerce types to be the same.
* lets create some vectors:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2.4, 3, 5) #what's the <- again?
x
str(x)
typeof(x)
```
**Couple of things**
* the `c()` function is used in R a lot - stands for combine and it will create a vector
* there are other ways to create a vector but we use this a lot. 
* what happens if we create a mixed vector


```{r}
y = c("dog", 1.4, 3.5, TRUE)
y
str(y)
typeof(y)
```

* What happened? 
* Yes, R converted this vector to all characters, but quotes around them. 
* This is b/c it wouldn't know how to convert dog or TRUE to numbers. 
* The coercion rules go: logical -> integer -> numeric -> complex -> character, where -> can be read as are transformed into.
* R has a number of functions that converts vectors between types, sometimes we need to do this, esp. if on read you data is something not expected.
* `as.numeric`, `as.logical`, `as.character`

```{r}
char_vector_nums <- c('1','2','3')
```

```{r}
typeof(as.numeric(char_vector_nums))
```


## Data structures = realistic example 

```{r}
str(gapminder)
summary(gapminder$country)
```

* What happened here? 
* Let's look up some help? What should i Run? 

```{r}
?summary
```

```{r}
summary(gapminder$country) # tell us lenght of character vector 

```

* But we want a diff summary, we'd lke to count up the occurances of our country. 
* To do this we need to convert the country vector to a factor. What's a factor? categorical variable, e.g. colors, breeds of dogs 

```{r eval=FALSE}
factor(gapminder$country)
```

* Note at the end, we can see 142 levels (or categories). Let's add this to our summary; how? 

```{r}
summary(factor(gapminder$country))
```

* Now what if we want to permanently save `country` as a factor. 
* We might not need to do this in in a real case b/c w can always do on the fly if needed, but we could need to do it so we can alter levels (they could be ordinal). 

* Let's add the factor version of `country` at the end of gapminder as a new column. How would you think we do that? 

```{r}
gapminder$countr_fac <- factor(gapminder$country)
```

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

* Notice the difference. 

* Ok let's look at some helpful methods to inspect the data. 

```{r}
typeof(gapminder$year)
typeof(gapminder$country)
str(gapminder$country)
str(gapminder$countr_fac)
length(gapminder)
typeof(gapminder)
```

* What's a list?? a data structure can be thought of as a container of many different types of objects. 
* All dataframes in R under the hood are list.
* But lists are important in R to be aware of b/c complex objects are lists
* This can include how statistical models are represented or plots 

Let's explore some other functions we can use to inspect dataframes: 

```{r}
nrow(gapminder)
ncol(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)
colnames(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
```

## Subsetting 

* What's a column in a data frame, again? 

* Right, it's a vector. Let's pull out a column as a vector by itself and explore how we subset vectors. 

```{r}
life_exp <- gapminder[['lifeExp']]
```

```{r}
str(life_exp)
```
* let's get the first element: 

```{r}
life_exp[1]
```
* hwat about elements 3 & 7
```{r}
life_exp[c(3,7)]
```
* we use the `c` function here
* what about a series or sequence? 
* first let's see how to do one in R
```{r}
1:4
```
* Note this will expand to [1,2,3,4]
```{r}
life_exp[1:4]
```
* to skip we use negatives
```{r eval=FALSE}
life_exp[-1:4]
```
Why didnt that work? 
Yes, -1:4 expands to -1,0,1,2,3,4
```{r}
-1:4
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
life_exp[-(1:4)]
```
Also works: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
life_exp[-c(1:4)]
```

### Data frames 
* Bracket notation - if we use a single bracket with number, it will return
* Single column as a dataframe

```{r}
head(gapminder[3])
```

```{r}
str(gapminder[3])
```

However if we use [[3]] it'll return the column as a vector 

```{r}
head(gapminder[[3]])
head(gapminder[["lifeExp"]])
```

```{r}
str(gapminder[[3]])
```

A vector. 

Think about it via this image: 

![Peeling onion](https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/DBDA_recoded/pics/pepper_list.png)

`$` dollar sign can pull out a column by name. A lot easier to remember names than their numbers. 

```{r}
head(gapminder$year)

```

We can pull out by rows and columns by using two arguments in `[]`

```{r}
gapminder[1:3,] #row 1-3 and all columns
gapminder[3,] #   
gapminder[3:10, 1:3]
```

Let's subset gapminder and only include data from 87

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder[gapminder$year == 1987, ]
```

How about population greater than 15,000,000

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder[gapminder$pop >= 15000000,]

```

### Selecting elements of a vector: 

* Selecting elements of a vector that match any of a list of components is a very common data analysis task
* gapminder data set contains country and continent variables 
* Suppose we want to pull out information from southeast Asia: 
* how do we set up an operation to produce a logical vector that is TRUE for all of the countries in southeast Asia and FALSE otherwise?
* Let's walk thru this together & follow along: 

```{r}
seAsia <- c("Myanmar","Thailand","Cambodia","Vietnam","Laos")
## extract the `country` column from a data frame (we'll see this later);
## convert from a factor to a character;
## and get just the non-repeated elements
countries <- unique(gapminder$country)
```

One way: 

```{r}
(countries=="Myanmar" | countries=="Thailand" |
 countries=="Cambodia" | countries == "Vietnam" | countries=="Laos") 
```

More elegant way and better way:  

```{r}
countries %in% seAsia
```
How to use with gapminder: 

```{r}
gapminder[gapminder$country %in% seAsia, ]
```

We will group you up in room. Select one person to drive the computer, the others will give instructions on how to solve the problems. The driver shares their screen. Switch up half way thru for fun.

## GGPLOT2 - 30min or less 

* R-base has a plot function but less intuitive:   `plot()`
* Ggplot2 should have been installed

But if not:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
```{r}
library("ggplot2")
```

* We will go over more of **ggplot2** tomorrow. 
* grammar of graphics - a way to express plots are layers of data and their visual expressions on a plot
* We select the data, map it to axis and tell ggplot how to represent it.

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

* we can transform the axis using a log10 scale 

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_log10()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line()
```

Make the points stand out:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country)) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(color=continent)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()
```
```{r}
americas <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas",] #subset
ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```
You'll get hands-on tomorrow with Stephanie. 
Thanks everyone!
